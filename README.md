#Quote deCode

##The game of restoring quotes to their true meaning

All the famous quotes of the world have been scrambled, and you need to fix them!

ðŸ’¥ðŸ“˜ðŸ’¥

Type in your guesses at the highlighted words (red for synonyms and blue for rhyming words) and hit enter. If you get stuck, either tap the word for more potential variants, or hit the cheat button. Either way, you'll lose points, but cheating removes the most!

Good luck, and decode for days!
